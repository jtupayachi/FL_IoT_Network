[93mWARNING [0m:   DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.client.start_client() is deprecated.
	Instead, use the `flower-supernode` CLI command to start a SuperNode as shown below:

		$ flower-supernode --insecure --superlink='<IP>:<PORT>'

	To view all available options, run:

		$ flower-supernode --help

	Using `start_client()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
